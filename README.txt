2. Testing Program
	After sucessfully building and debugging our code for the program, we tested our program for corrected by ensuring the information in the printed 
	statements to the output were correct as well as we compared the outputed .txt files to the expected result.txt files for each of the corresponding 
	.txt documents.
3. Challenges
	Reading through the lab 2 takehome document and determining the logic of the code was difficult at first, however, after reading through the 
	document we wrote out the logic and plan for the program on paper first which allowed us to easily write the code for the program.
4. Hours
5. Percentage
	Both partners worked evenly on all aspects of the program and both contibuted ~50% each.
6. Division of Workload
	We both worked together in determining the logic of the program as well as going through as debugging the program. Hubert focused more on the 
	____ part of the code and Lisa worked mainly on the analyze_segments function and assisted with the calculate_score function, while both assisted in the development of the code for the other partner.
